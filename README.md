# weird-json

A menagerie of strange, encoded JSONs, for connoisseurs.

JSON superset, supporting BigInts, TypedArrays, null, undefined and Symbol.

Supports the full 17-plane Unicode 13, and codes it down to ASCII without Base64.

> What's the point of this? I mean it's clearly a joke, but... Why? Oh yeah, let's invent a new incompatible standard. Great idea. Just a reminder to everyone, don't use this in production!

> This sucks. Real JSON is waay better than OP. Or at least use Protobuf, it's popular and created by Google, or bson. Don't use this, it's clearly a security nightmare.

> Hmm, interesting idea. Have you ever heard of Base64? Just curious why you chose to name it 46? And why JSON? There's specific definitions of 46, and JSON, and they don't say anything about this. Did I miss something in the JSON spec?

## get to know the current JSONs-in-residence

The merry little band of tricksters: *JSON46*, *JSON36*, *JSON37* and ever-affable *JSON38*

### JSON46

Forged in the fires of Mordor, the hand-polished 46 runic sigils of our exclusive 46 line cover all your possible use cases. You can make a Chinese JSON, an emoji JSON, and then safely protect it and in the darkness bind it so only 36 alphanumerics plus 7 unique JSON structural symbols, plus 3 highly-coveted numeric specifiers (`e`, `+` and `-`) are present.  

Features:

- alphabet: a-z, 0-9, `:,"[]{}.+-`
- JSON superset, supports BigInt, TypedArrays, null, undefined and Symbol

Complete ASCII. Complete URL safe. But not safe enough? Try *JSON36*. :tada:

### JSON36

Like JSON46, but encoded again into the 36ers: a-z, 0-9. Fully [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/declassified_136216.htm) [compliant](https://archives.nato.int/phonetic-alphabet;isad).

### JSON37

Like JSON46, but compressed with LZW, then encoded into the 36ers: a-z, 0-9 plus `.` Also, NATO phonetic alphabet compliant.

### JSON38

Like JSON37, but separated into stanzas separted by `-` dash. Also, NATO phonetic alphabet OK.

## design

- can I have a Jason format that effortlessly supports Unicode everywhere without any problems?
- can I have a text and coding format to make everything ASCII for transport that isn't affected by different apis for base64 and no JS and the browser?
- can I have a Jason that supports Biggins and typed arrays as well as null undefined and symbols?
- is there a encoding to ASCII text that I can easily access in JavaScript in the browser and in node without writing it myself nor importing a dependency?
- what if I want to say JSON over the telephone or radio?

All these encoding designs are inspired by the availability of base 36 in Node and Browser, and also in people's brains.

## get 

Them all:

```console
$ npm i --save weird-json
```

Or just one:

```console
$ npm i --save json36
```

## use

```js
import {JSON36} from 'weird-json';
import JSON46 from 'json46';
import json37 from 'json37';
```
